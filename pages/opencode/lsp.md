# ⚡ Language Server Protocol (LSP) Integration

Unlock the full power of Opencode with Language Server Protocols! LSPs provide real-time code intelligence, error detection, and smart refactoring for a seamless AI-assisted development experience.

---

## 🤔 What are Language Servers?

Language Server Protocol (LSP) is a standardized protocol that provides intelligent language features like code completion, error detection, and refactoring. LSPs understand the structure, syntax, and semantics of your code in real-time.



## 🚀 Why LSPs Transform AI-Assisted Development

- **🧠 Enhanced AI Understanding:**
  - Structured code analysis
  - Context awareness (classes, functions, variables, dependencies)
  - Real-time intelligence (type info, method signatures, code structure)
- **⚡ Performance Advantages:**
  - Faster processing (up to 10x vs. text parsing)
  - Memory efficiency (cached symbol info)
  - Incremental updates (analyze only changed code)
- **🎯 More Accurate AI Assistance:**
  - Precise suggestions
  - Real-time error prevention
  - Smart, context-aware refactoring
- **📈 Scalable Development:**
  - Handles enterprise-scale codebases
  - Cross-file intelligence
  - Framework awareness



## 🛠️ Multi-LSP Configuration

Configuration supports multiple Language Server implementations for full-stack development:

- **🐘 PHP (Phpactor):** `.php` — Class analysis, refactoring, composer awareness
- **🎨 CSS/Styling:** `.css`, `.scss`, `.sass`, `.twig` — Property validation, responsive design hints
- **🐳 Docker:** `Dockerfile` — Best practices, security, build optimization
- **🌊 Tailwind CSS:** `.css`, `.scss`, `.sass`, `.twig`, `.js` — Utility completion, design system integration



## 🌟 The Result: AI-Powered Development Excellence

With LSP integration, Opencode becomes an intelligent development partner that:
- **Understands** your project architecture
- **Suggests** contextually relevant improvements
- **Prevents** errors before they happen
- **Accelerates** development through intelligent automation
