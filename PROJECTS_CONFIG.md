# Projects Configuration Guide

This documentation hub now uses a YAML-based configuration system for managing projects displayed on the homepage.

## Configuration File

The projects are configured in `_data/projects.yml`. This file contains all project definitions that will be displayed on the homepage.

## Project Structure

Each project in the YAML file has the following structure:

```yaml
- title: "ðŸ”§ Project Title"           # Display title with optional emoji
  description: "Project description"   # Brief description of the project
  url: "/path/to/project"             # URL (internal or external)
  type: "internal"                    # "internal" or "external"
  category: "documentation"           # Category for organization
  featured: true                      # Whether to show on homepage
```

## Fields Explanation

- **title**: The display name of the project (supports emojis)
- **description**: A brief description shown on the project card
- **url**: The link to the project (can be relative for internal links or absolute for external)
- **type**: 
  - `internal`: Links within the documentation site
  - `external`: Links to external websites
- **category**: Used for organizing projects (e.g., "documentation", "development", "company")
- **featured**: Boolean flag to control whether the project appears on the homepage

## Adding New Projects

To add a new project:

1. Edit `_data/projects.yml`
2. Add a new project entry following the structure above
3. Set `featured: true` if you want it to appear on the homepage
4. Commit and push your changes

## Example: Adding a New Project

```yaml
- title: "ðŸ“š API Documentation"
  description: "Complete API reference for all Akawaka services and endpoints."
  url: "/api/"
  type: "internal"
  category: "documentation"
  featured: true
```

## Benefits of This System

1. **Easy Management**: Add/remove projects without editing HTML
2. **Consistent Structure**: All projects follow the same format
3. **Flexible Display**: Control which projects are featured
4. **Future-Proof**: Easy to extend with additional fields
5. **Version Control**: Changes are tracked in Git

## Jekyll Integration

The homepage (`index.html`) automatically reads from this configuration:

```liquid
{% for project in site.data.projects.projects %}
  {% if project.featured %}
    <!-- Project card HTML -->
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```

This ensures that any changes to the YAML file are immediately reflected on the website.
