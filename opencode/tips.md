## ðŸ’¡ Tips & Details

### 1. Run Shell Commands in Your Session (`!`)

> **Available since:** Opencode v0.4.43  
> **How:** Prefix any input with `!` to run a shell command directly in your session.

- **Why:** The output is visible to both you and the agent, making it easy to provide extra context or debug issues together.
- **Example:**  
  ```shell
  ! git status
  ```
  This will run `git status` in your current project directory and display the result in the chat window (see screenshot below).

- **Use case:**  
  - Quickly check the state of your repo, list files, or run tests.
  - Share command outputs with the agent for troubleshooting or context.

### 2. Navigate Subagent Sessions (`ctrl+right` / `ctrl+left`)

> **Available since:** Opencode v0.5.2  
> **How:**  
> - `ctrl+right` â€” Enter a child (subagent) session  
> - `ctrl+left` â€” Return to the parent session

- **Why:** Opencode supports hierarchical agent sessions. This feature lets you dive into subagent conversations (for example, when an agent spawns a helper agent) and then return to your main session, keeping complex workflows organized and easy to follow.
