# OpenCode Plugin Development Guide

Welcome to the OpenCode Plugin Developer Documentation!

> ⚠️ **AI-Generated Documentation**
>
> This documentation was generated by AI after analyzing the OpenCode project. While it aims to be accurate and helpful, there is currently no official, complete documentation for plugin creation. 
> 
> **Developers should always verify details by checking the actual OpenCode source code.** 
> 
> Use this guide as a starting point, but exercise caution and validate all technical information against the codebase.

This guide will help you create, extend, and distribute plugins for the OpenCode agent platform. Whether you’re new to plugins or an experienced developer, you’ll find everything you need to build powerful, secure, and maintainable extensions.
